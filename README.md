HTML Lists – Basics to Advanced
This repository demonstrates the use of HTML lists with practical examples ranging from simple to advanced structures. Lists are a fundamental way to organize content on web pages, and this project explores all three types:

📋 Types of Lists
Ordered List (<ol>)  
Displays items in a numbered or lettered sequence. Supports attributes like:

type → change numbering style (1, A, i, etc.)

start → set a custom starting number

reversed → display numbering in descending order

Unordered List (<ul>)  
Displays items with bullet points. Common styles include:

disc, circle, square (via list-style-type in CSS)

Description List (<dl>)  
Defines terms and their descriptions using:

<dt> → term

<dd> → description

🧩 Features in This Repo
Nested lists (lists inside lists) for hierarchical structures

Different numbering styles (A, i, etc.)

Reversed and custom start values in ordered lists

Combination of <ul>, <ol>, and <dl> for real-world examples

🚀 Usage
Open the provided .html files in your browser to see how lists render.
Experiment by editing attributes (type, start, reversed) or adding new nested levels to deepen your understanding.
